# Julia Workshop ODSC '17 (San Francisco)

## Instructions

1. Log in to https://next.juliabox.com

2. Click 'Packages' / 'Yours', and add the following packages by typing their name in the text box, and clicking the '+' button.
    - SymPy
    - Query
    - Flux
    - BenchmarkTools

3. Click the 'Start' button to begin the installation process.

4. Click 'New' / 'Terminal'. A terminal will open in a new tab on your browser. In the terminal type the following commands:

```
cd /home/jrun
git clone https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ODSC
cp -R /home/jrun/ODSC /mnt/juliabox
```

### Update
Instead of following step 4 to clone the repo, we just recently added a `git` plugin, which you can try: 

1. Copy `https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ODSC.git`
2. Click 'Git', paste. 
3. Click on the '+' button. 

If this doesn't work, just follow step 4 from the previous section.
